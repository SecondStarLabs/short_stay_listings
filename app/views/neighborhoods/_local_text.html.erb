                    <h2>Why Choose Almost Home Corporate Housing?</h2>
<h3>Salt Lake City Temporary Housing: A Welcome Alternative to Long Hotel Stays</h3>
Almost Home offers the same features and amenities that can be found in a resort hotel...plus many more:
<ul>
	<li>Home Environment</li>
	<li>On-site washer &amp; dryer</li>
	<li>Full-sized living rooms</li>
	<li>More freedom and privacy</li>
	<li>Fully equipped kitchens</li>
	<li>Private mailbox</li>
	<li>Amenities such as pool and fitness center</li>
</ul>
                    <p>Most hotel rooms offer basic amenities, limited square footage and sterile decor. In comparison, Almost Home corporate apartments have a comfortable, home-like feel, and a lot more space to relax and unwind thus making them perfect for extended-stay business travelers, entertainment industry clients, relocating employees, and others seeking a spacious alternative to lengthy stays in a hotel. Corporate apartments consist of a housing package that includes linens, housewares, furniture, rent and all utilities including local telephone and basic cable. Furnished apartments offer the best amenities that you could otherwise not get from staying in hotels, as well as all of the advantages you have with living in an apartment. For example, a Salt Lake City corporate apartment will have on average double the square footage of a hotel room, as well as a kitchen fully stocked with all of the necessary items for cooking. In fact, all you will need if you are staying in a Salt Lake City furnished apartment is your suitcase and a bag of groceries. Corporate housing leases are usually short term leases of around 3 months, but they can also be as little as 30 days or as long as several years. With corporate housing, you'll be saving money over a hotel while avoiding the drain of the open road.
